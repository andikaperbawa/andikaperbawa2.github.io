about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am geophysicist with 11 years of experience in both oil and gas industry and academia. As a professional exploration geophysicist, I have been working in prospect generation, risk assessment, drilling program, post-drill analysis and plan of development project. My strongest skills include advance seismic interpretation, quantitative analysis and geological modeling. 

  As an academia, I have been working in the experimental research investigating rock properties using geomechanics and rock physics approach. My current research includes carbon dioxide study on carbonate rocks for enhanced oil recovery and carbon storage. I also working on machine learning application for geoscience. I have two invention disclosures about machine learning applications.

          The dissertation is focusing on broadband elastic wave propagation in intact rocks. The study investigates the effect of frequency, fluid type (brine and supercritical CO2), and temperature on velocity and attenuation in reservoir rocks. I designed and manufactured a new resonant column device for low-frequency attenuation measurement. I also modified standard triaxial frame to perform cyclic loading on fluid-saturated rock specimen at seismic-frequency.

          The thesis investigates a "sweetspot" of shale gas potential in south Sumatra basin Indonesia using an integrated study of simultaneous seismic inversion, pore pressure prediction and total organic carbon prediction.

          The final project includes the development of Matlab code to perform synthetic modeling of time-lapse borehole microgravity. This numerical model allows prediction and simulation of microgravity anomaly along the wellbore during hydrocarbon production and gas injection monitoring.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
